# CSCI311-Project1
This program was written in python3, which you need to have installed to run 

To run this file you just need to run `interface.py` through the console with python, typically that command would look like `python {PATH TO FOLDER}\interface.py` or if you are currently in the folder just `python interface.py`

Once you run the interface you should get something like this

To access each menu option input(type the number and press enter) the number corresponding to that menu option, just the number nothing else

Set files will ask for both the sequence file and the query file which you will have to input both to proceed, just input the same file name if you don't want to change it. 
All the files that you want to access **must** be in the same folder as `interface.py`

If you're using the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm you'll have the option to change the weighting/scoring for matches, mismatches and indels
